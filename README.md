# Personal Portfolio

The aim of this project is to 'reactify' my [personal-portfolio](https://github.com/ryanjwise/ca-t1a2-portfolio). 

## About

This site is already live and fully functional at: https://ryanjwise.netlify.app/. However, as it is currently written in plain html and sass, it is very cumbersome and difficult to maintain. For this reason I am migrating it to this repository using React to make my HTML components, signigicantly more DRY.

This is also a great opportunity to get a bit hands on with REACT, so whilst I will try to keep the existing styling, I may make some changes for optimisation here and there.

## Usage

This is still very much a work in progress, however if you would like to view the in development process:

1. `clone` this repository
1. `cd` into it' root directory
1. run `yarn install`
1. run `yarn start`
1. if not opened automatically, open a browser to `http://localhost:3000/`
