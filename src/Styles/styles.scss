Used to control more complex arrays containing two or more objects in each item.
As these arrays are typically used as navigation aids, the header is styled as a clickable button
and unless overridden other elements are hidden on a mobile device.

Breaks into 3 main componants:
1. Header button with clickable a tag
2. Image
3. Contextual infomration

This is used on both the projects page and the master blog page.
